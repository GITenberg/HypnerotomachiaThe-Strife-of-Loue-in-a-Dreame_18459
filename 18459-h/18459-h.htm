Neuerthelesse glad I was to see the light: as one set at libertie, that

of mens hands, and number of workmen, such a piece of woorke could bee
by great strength framed, with much paine layde together, and a long

that no man could go further forward or backe againe, but to enter in by

Vpon this massie frame and mightie woorkmanship, which I take to be in

placed a high and woonderfull Pyramides, after the fashion of a square
poynted Diamond, and such incredible workemanship that could neuer be
deuised and erected, without inestimable charge, great helpe, and long

quaile the rest of the spirituall sences. VVhat shall I say more? for so

And of the same stone of <i>Paros</i> as were the steps: which cube and
square stone was the Basis and foote set vnder the Obilisk, which I haue
in hand to describe.</p>

<p class = "main">
This mightie big stone sharpe topt, sliding downe the extream part from
corner to corner, flat sided by the Diameter, was fower paces, at euery
equall distant corner, whereof was the foote of a harpie of moulten
mettall, their steales and clawes armed. Firmlye and stronglie set in
with led, in euery corner of the Cube, or foure square head of the
Pyramides, meeting together ouer the Diagonike line. Of proportioned
thicknesse in heigth two paces. Which thus closing and mette together,
made the socket of the great Obelisk: which Socket was beautified with
leaues, fruites and flowers, of shining cast mettall, and of conuenient
bignesse. VVherevpon the weight of the Obelisk was borne. The breadth
whereof was two paces, and seauen in heigth, artificiously sharping of
the stone of <i>Thebais</i> called <i>Pyrus</i>. Vpon the smooth plains
whereof, pure and bright shining as a looking glasse, were moste
excellently cut <i>Aegiptian Hyerogliphs</i>.</p>

<p class = "main">
Vpon the pointe of which Obelisk, with great arte and diligence, was
fastned a copper base, in the which also there was a turning deuise
infixed: whervpon did stand the shape of a beautifull nimph framed of
the aforesayd matter, able to amaze the continuall diligent behoulder.
Of such a proportion as the common stature might be considered and
perfectly seene, notwithstanding the exceeding heigth thereof in the
ayre. Besides the greatnesse of the figure or image: it was a woonder to
thinke how such a weight should bee carryed and set in such a place and
so high. Couered with a habite blowne abroad with the winde, and shewing
parte of the naked substance of the legges and thighes: with two wings
growing out from the shoulder blades, and spred abroad as if shee were
readye to flye, turning hir fayre face and sweete regarding countenance
towardes hir wings. The tresses of hir haire <ins class = "edcorr" title

copie or horne stuft full of many good things, stopped vp, and the mouth
downewarde, hir left hand fastned and harde holden to hir naked brest.
This Image and stature was with euery blast of wind turned, and mooued
about with such a noyse and tinkling in the hollownes of the metaline
deuise: as if the mynte of the Queene of England had

about, did rub and grinde vpon the copper base, fixed vpon the pointe of
the Obeliske, it gaue such a sound, as if the tower bell of Saint Iohns
Colledge in the famous Vniuersitie of Cambridge had beene rung: or that
in the pompeous Batches of the mightie <i>Hadrian</i>: or that in the
fift Pyramides standing vpon foure. This Obeliske in my iudgement was
such, as neyther that in the <i>Vaticane</i> in <i>Alexandria</i> or
Babilon, may bee equally compared vnto it, but rather esteemed far
inferiour. It conteined in it such a heape of woonders, as I could not
without great astonishment looke vpon it. As also consider the hugenesse
of the worke, the excessiue sumptuousnesse, the straunge inuention, the
rare performance, and exquisite diligence of the woorkeman. With what
art inuented? with what power, humaine force, and incredible meanes,
enuying (if I may speake it) the workmanship of the heauens, such and so
mightie weights should be transported and carryed into the skyes? with

To the aforesaid entrance thorow the open mouth of <i>Medusa</i>, I came
by a long gallorie to a salying scale or downe going staire opening at
the foot and pauement of the building vpon my right hand against one of
the collaterall and side-lying mountaines, betwixt which there was out
of the stone and open space cut out of tenne paces vp, into the which I
ascended boldely without resistance, and being come to the beginning of
the staire in the aforesaid mouth by innumerable steppes and degrees,
not without great wearines and disinesse of head, by often turning
about, I came to so incredible a height, that my eies would not suffer
me to looke downe to the ground insomuch, that me thought that euery
thing below vpon the plaine had lost his shape, and seemed vnperfect. In
the opening and comming out of this circulate and turning assence many

their large and tall bodyes, vnpossible to be rightlye described, the
artificiall handling thereof, as it were enuying the woorke of nature

from one part to an other, with an expedite passage and swift course. In

cast downe, other stumbling and falling: many wounded and hurt, yeelding
vp their desired liues: some troden downe and mischieued vnder the feete
of the fierce and vnrestrained horsses. Other casting off their armour
wrastling and togging one with another: some headlong with their heeles
vpwarde, falling and not come to the ground from off their horsses.
Other some lying vpon the earth, houlding vp their sheilds and Targets,
offended with the one hand, and defended with the other. Many with their
shimitaries and curtilaxes, some with long swordes two handed after the
auncient Persian manner, others with diuers deadly and strange fashioned

deuises vpon their crests: others naked and vnarmed, leaping and rushing

vndaunted courages, resolute for death. Some with fearefull countenances
crying out, other shewing obstinate and furious visages, although they
were assured to dye, strongly abiding the proofe of their paine, and the
cutting in sunder of their fatall thread, others slaine before them,
with diuers vncothe and straunge warlike and deadly instruments. Shewing
their strong members, their swelling muskels standing out, offering to

Thus willingly going forward, I came to a vast and wonderfull large

lay with the face vpward all of molten mettal, like a man of middle age,
and his head lifted vp as with a pillowe, with a resemblance of one that

Of these the third part was round, and the reason of their cutting in
such sort (that is two parts chamfered, &amp; the third round) as I

husband and the wife, or the father and the daughter, and such like. And
therefore the expert and cunning workemen in elder time for the feminine
sex, did vse more chamfering and channelling and double varietie then
for the masculine, because of their slippery and vnconstant nature.</p>

<p class = "main">
The cause of so much rebating was to shew that this was the temple of a
goddesse, for chamfering dooth set foorth the plytes of feminine

closing the same, and putting downe the couer, both partes being holow,

The paued ground vnder the water being of a diuers emblemature of hard

sweete and temperatelye hotte, not like a Hotte-house or Stew, but
naturally cleansing it selfe beyond all credet, there was no meanes to

glistering of a golden colour, that one might see himselfe therein.
Which were fastened in a Marble, cut into a squadrature, and euacuated
for the Images to stand in their proportions, with two halfe Collumnes
that is Hemiciles, one of either side, with a Trabet, a smal Zophor, and
a Coronice, all cut in one sollid Marble, and this peece of worke was
nothing inferior to any of the rest, which before I had seene, but with
a rare art, and marueilous inuention, both deuised and performed. In the
voyd and plaine euacuated quadret, there stood two Nimphes, little lesse

somewhat aboue their knees, vppon one of theyr legges, as if the winde

from the elbow to the shoulder except. And vpon that arme, wherewith
they sustained the Boye, the habite that was lifted vp was reiect. The
feete of the Infant stood one in one of the handes of the Nymphes, and

The Infant holding his little Instrument in both his hands, and

One of them called <i>Achoe</i>, verie affably and with a pleasant

would commaund me, went to the place. And I had no sooner set my foote
vpon the steppe, to receiue the water, as it fell, but the pissing Boye
lift vp his pricke, and cast sodeinlye so colde water vppon my face,

After our great laughter and bathing, and all hauing washed with a

seates, tripping on their toes, where they did annoynt themselues with
sweete Odours, Diasdasmatic, and with a Myristic liquor, or water of
Nutmegges. And they offered a boxe vnto mee also, and I annoynted my

beganne to sing verses in a Phrygial tune, of a pleasaunt metamorphosing

so euer I turned, I could not forbeare, and they as they sung laughed
the more, knowing what had happened vnto mee. And it did so increase in
mee more and more, that I knew not wherewithal I might bridle and
restraine my selfe from catching of one of them, like an eager and hotte

<p class = "main">
At this my lamentable and sorrowing answere, they were prouoked to such

somewhat pleased that I had made them to runne. I returned backe to
gather vp their Pantophles and such things as they had scattered behind

in a sodaine was placed frames of Hebony, with three feete, and other

the which were three stypits, the lower partes whereof, did finish in
the forme of the tearing claw of a Lyon, with an exsquisite foliature,

Garland a bundle of leaues and fruites bounde togither, and biggest

Harpyes feete, the which in a foliature made a trianguled illygament to
the base, full of deuises, as the mettall required, ouer euerie Angle or

There were six in a round circuit, one towardes an other: And betwixt

Then I presumed further to knowe, what should these two things vpon

that this monstrous shape and machine was not made without great and
wonderfull humane wisedome, much labour, and incredible diligence, with
a perplexibility of vnderstanding to knowe the mysticall conceite. Thou

and seeing that I might speake boldly, I made this third question. Most
wise Nymph, in my comming out of the subterraneall vast darksome place,
as I passed on, I came to a goodlie bridge, and vppon the same, in a
Porphyrite stone vppon the one side, and an Ophite vpon the other, I
beheld engrauen certaine Hieragliphs, both which I did interprete, but I
stoode doubtfull of certaine branches, that were tyed to the hornes of

Woodes bee, that the one will not easily take fire, and the other will
neither bend, rotte, consume, nor be eaten with wormes. And so that
patience is commended, which with anger is not kindled, nor by aduersity
will bee subdued.</p>

<p class = "main">
The nature of the Porphyrit stone is of this secrecie, that in the
fornace it will neither burne it selfe, but also causeth other stones
neere adioyning that they shall not burne. And of that nature is
patience, that it will neither be altered itselfe, nor suffer any other
wherein it beareth rule to fall into a furie. And the Ophite stone is of
such nature also.</p>

<p class = "main">

not knowing what I did, but casting mine eyes right forward, I behelde
before mee, a fine Arbour of sweete Gessamine, somewhat high, lifting

Alas said I, with a deepe sigh, my <i>Polia</i>, that the greene Arbour
resounded againe therewithall, my amourous breathings were such, framed

into this agony, and ouerwhelmed in this passion, but as I passed on to

Which white smocke seemed as if it had couered damaske Roses.</p>

<p class = "main">
The coate which she wore ouer that, was not like our fashioned

needed no such pinching in, &amp; vnholsome weare, hyndering procreation
and an enemie to health: but rather like a wastcoate, with little
plightes and gathers vnder her rounde and pretty bearing out breasts,
vpon her slender and small waste, ouer her large proportioned flanckes
and little round belly, fast girded about with a girdle of golde: and
ouer the same, a gowne or garment side to the ground, and welted

This garment beeing very side, was taken vp round about the pitch of her

beene <i>Minerua</i> her selfe. Her armes to be seene through the cleere
thinnesse of the Lawne, the winges about the size of her garment where
her armes came out, were of golde, in an excellent sort and fashion
welted, and set with Pearle and stone: and in like sort, all the hemming

Vppon either side, vnder the armes to her waste, her vpper garment was
vnsowed and open, but fastened with three buttons of great Orient Pearle
(such as <i>Cleopatra</i> neuer had to dissolue in a Potion) in loopes
of blewe silke, so that you might see her smocke betweene the distance
of one Pearle from an other, couering her daintie soft snowye thinne
skinne: except her small necke and the vpper halfe of her spatious and
delitious breast, more desired and contenting mine eyes, then the water

sweet &amp; pleasant sort, to cast down her eyes vpon her little round
swelling breastes, impatient at the suppressing of her soft and fine
apparell: so as I iudged vppon good consideration, and thought that in
the dignitie and honourable frame of her personage, the Creator had
framed and vnited together, all the violence of Loue. The foure Nourses

and couering the same almost to her forheade: from the middle vpper
point whereof, in forme of two Hemycycles to the halfe of her eares, it

themselues two pleasant radious and glistering eyes, which would enforce

By all which sight I was greatly mooued and my sences rauished with a
kindled appetite, causing among them great strife and bitter contention,
such as I neuer felt before, by any other presence or excellent sightes
whatsoeuer. My searching eyes commended one part aboue another, to bee
more beautifull: but my appetite rapt into an other part of her heauenly
body, esteeming that aboue the other. And thus my insatiable and wanton
eyes, were the euill beginning of all thys perturbing and contentious
commotion, whome I founde the seminaries and moouers of all so great
strife and trouble, in my wounded and festering heart. Through theyr
contumacy, I was now brought from my selfe, and neuerthelesse, I could
not be satisfied by them. My greedy appetyte extolled her delicate
breast aboue any comparison, my eyes delightfully consenting thervnto,
sayd, at least by that we may discouer what y<sup>e</sup> rest is; And
they, glauncing from that to the regarde of her grace and gesture, set
all their delight therein: and my appetite strengthened and not easilie
remooued from thence, I perswaded my selfe, that the plentie and
fayrenesse of her head and hayre, and the dressing thereof, and the
beautie of her forheade, coulde neuer bee compared with of any one or

say, that no mortall man hath seene, so gracious, so shyning, so cleere

heauenly creature; so that by them my hart was taken prisoner, &amp; was

On the other side, I perswaded my selfe, that if I shoulde offer vnto

meane and large entrance, for the discouery of my desire. But my burning
heart humbly hauing opened the same, euen as a rype Apple being eyther

wounded and familiar estuation, in some interposition of time,
immediatly his accustomed heat and feruor increased, piercing the inward
parts with her virgineall aspects, exceedingly beautified with a comely
grace and vnexcogitable elegancie; Because, that into this sweete
introduction into my minde, of these first amorous flames, (lyke the
Troian horse, full of weapons and deceite) the enterance was made for an

my immedicable wounde grewe greater and greater. But gathering vp the
remaynder of my sences, as one that durst, I assured my selfe to

Vpon the middle of which plaine there was placed a base of golde by the
lowest diameter, one foote and three handfuls high, the lataster or
lowest verdge round and hollowed, in the middle vnder the vpper sime or
brimme in forme of a pallie with nextrubs, rules and cordicels: the
vpper plaine of this base was euacuated, wherein rested the traines of
the fower eagles standing vpon the plaine, smooth superficies of the
base, which were of precious Ætite of Persia, of the colour of a sakers
plume. And these stood with their shoulders one opposite against
another, and their pounces of gold fastened and sticking in the said
base, euery one surueying with their wings, and the flowering tips of
their sarcellets touching one another. Ouer these as vpon a nest, was
placed this maruellous vessell of Æthiopian Hyacints cleere and bright,
<i>Celso inimicus, Comiti gratiosus</i>. This vessell was crusted with
emeralds and vaines of diuers other pretious stones, a worke incredible.
The height thereof two foote and a halfe, the fashion in maner round,
the breadth by diameter one foote and a halfe, and the circumference
consisted of three diameters. From the heads of the eagles the bottome
or foote of the vessell did ascend vp one triens, and a border going

the forme of the vessell aforesaid one handfull and a halfe broader,
which halfe handfull was distributed to the border, about the brimme of
foulding leaues and flowers standing out from the hyacinth. The diameter
two quarters &amp; a halfe. Vnder this border there did stick out round
about certaine proportions like walnut shels, or the keele of a ship,
somwhat thicke and broade at the vpper end, and lessing themselues to

in steed of eares to take vp the vessell by, it had two lips standing
out and turning in round like the head of a base viall.</p>

<p class = "main">
Vnder and aboue the borders, the vessel was wrought with turned gululs,
vnduls, and imbossings, and with such lineaments were the borders
wrought, both vnder and aboue. Vppon the border in the necke of the
couer, were two halfe rings, suppressed in the border by transuersion,
one of them iust against another, which were holden in the biting teeth
of two Lysarts, or byting Dragons of greene emerauld, bearing out from
the couer. They stoode with their serpentlike feete vpon the lower part
of the couer vnder the necke, betwixt the which and the lower vessell,
was one quantitie, and from his vpper gracilament descending, he ioyned
with the turned in sime of the circumferent lymbus or verdge, where they
did closely byte togither. This couer to the necke was made in skalie
work of <i>Hyacinth</i>, except the vaynes of smaragd, for the little
dragons, their bellies and feetes fastening to the skalie couer. These
little dragons one against an other, their brests and throtes hollowing
out from the border and the couer, and their tayles turning vpwards
againe, did serue for the eares of the couer, iust ouer them of the

appearing thorough the same of Hiacinth so round and polished, as any
wheele can send foorth: except, vnder the leaues there was a substaunce
left, which helde the foliature to the vessell of Hiacinth, passing ouer

the other lapicidariall lineaments, were performed with such an

Let vs nowe returne to the circumferent brim of the pretious vessell. In

<i>Iupiter</i>, holding in his right hande a glistering sword, of the

crowned with stars like lightening, he stoode vpon an aultar of Saphyre.
Before his fearefull maiestie, were a beuie of Nymphs, seauen in number,
apparrelled in white, proffering with their sweete voices to sing, and
after transforming themselues into greene trees like emeralds full of
azure flowers, and bowing themselues downe with deuotion to his power:
Not that they were all transformed into leaues, but the first into a

the frame there were little naked boies, climing vp and sitting aloft
gathering the ripe clusters: others offering them in a basket to the

autumne: others singing and piping: all which expression was perfected
by the workman in pretious stones, of such colour as the naturall
liuelinesse of euery vaine, leafe, flower, berrie, body, proportion,
shape, and representation required. And in this imagerie, although it
was very small, yet there was no defect to be found in the least part
belonging thereunto, but perfectly to be discerned.</p>

Out of this former described vessell did spring vp a greene flourishing
vine, the twisting branches thereof full set with clusters of grapes,
the tawny berries of Indian Amethyst, and the leaues of greene Silenitis

<i>Cupid</i>. This tree shadowed the chariot: At euery corner of this
triumphant chariot vpon the plaine where the vessell stood, was placed a
candlesticke, of excellent workmanship, vpon three feet of red corrall,
well liked of the ruder sort, resisting lightening and tempests,
fauourable and preseruatiue to the bearer: The like were not found vnder
the head of <i>Gorgon</i> of Persia, nor in the Ocean <i>Erythreum</i>.
The steale of one of the candlesticks was of white corrall, beloued of
<i>Diana</i>, of a conuenient length, with round knobs and ioints, in
height two foote. Another was of most fine stone <i>Dionisias</i>,
hauing spots growing from a blackish to a pure red, the same pounded
smelleth sweetly. The third was of perfect <i>Medea</i> of the colour of
darke gold, and hauing the smell of Nectar. The fourth of pretious
<i>Nebritis</i> from a blacke growing to a white and greene. Out of the
hollowed steales whereof, there ascended vp a pyramidall flame of
euerlasting fire, continually burning. The brightnes of the works
expressed through the reflexion of the lights, and the sparkling of the
pretious stones were such, as my eies dazeled to behold them.</p>

a moderate height of greene lawrell, fruitefull memerels, hearie &amp;
high pine trees, and within the cleere channels, with graueled banks,

There were a great companie of delicate faire Nymphs of tender age, with
a redolent flower of bashfulnes, and beyond all credite beautifull, with
their beardles louers continuallie accompanied. Among which Nymphs, some
verie pleasantly with wanton countenaunces in the cleere streams shewed
themselues sportefull and gamesome, hauing taken vppe finelie their thin
garments of silke of diuers colours, and holding them in the bouts of
their white armes, the forme of their rounde thighs were seene vnder the

faire faces of exceeding beautie, and bending their bodies of rare
proportion, as in a large goodly glasse they might behould their
heauenly shapes, breaking off the same with the motion of their pretie
feete, making a noyse with the contrast of the circulating water. Some
solaciouslie striuing to go by the tame swimming swans, and sportingly
casting water one at another, with the hollownes of their palms: others
standing without the water vpon the soft coole grasse, making vp of

<i>Axius</i> in <i>Mygdonia</i>, vnder the vmbragious trees, did sit
sporting and deuising one with another in delightfull imbracings, with
their reuerencing louers, not cruelly scorning &amp; reiecting them, but
with a sociable loue and benigne affablenesse, disposing themselues to
the like shew of true affection, their sweete gestures and pleasant

frowarde and vnmercifull <i>Cupid</i>, the sweete fountaines and moist

<p class = "main">
Some did sing amorous sonnets, and verses of loue, breathing out in the

able to enamorate harts of stone: And to make smooth the ruggednesse of
the vnpassageable mountaine <i>Caucasus</i>, to staie whatsoeuer furie
the harpe of <i>Orpheus</i> woulde prouoke, and the fowle and euill
fauoured face of <i>Medusa</i>, to make any horrible monster tame and
tractable, and to stop the continuall prouocation of the deuouring
<i>Scylla</i>. Some rested their heads in the chaste laps of their faire
loues, recounting the pleasaunt deuises of <i>Iupiter</i>, and they
instrophyating their curled locks with sweete smelling flowers.</p>

<p class = "main">
Others of them fained that they were forsaken, and seemed to flie and go
awaie from them, whom dearely they did affect, and then was there
running one after another with loud laughters, and effeminate criengs
out, their faire tresses spredding downe ouer their snowie shoulders
like threeds of gold, bound in laces of greene silke: Some loose after a
Nymphish maner, others bounde vp in attyres of golde set with pearle.
Afterwards comming neere togither, they would stowpe downe, and twiching

solace, maintaining their fained disgracings.</p>

Others with great curtesie were putting of Rose leaues one after another

their louers (if ouer-bold) vpon the cheekes with their harmles palmes
pretie ticks, making them red like the wheeles of <i>Phœbus</i> in a
faire and cleere morning: with other new and vnthought contentions, such
as loue could deuise. They all being pleasant, merrie, and disposed to
delight: Their gestures and motions girlish, and of a virgineall
simplicitie, putting on sincere loue without the offence of honorable
vertue: Free and exempt from the occursion of griefe or emulation of
aduers fortune: Sitting vnder the shade of the weeping sister of the
whited <i>Phaeton</i>, and of the immortall <i>Daphne</i> and hairie
pineapple with small and sharpe leaues, streight Cyprus, greene Orenge
trees, and tall Cedars, and others most excellent, abounding with greene

that would not be stirred vp to heate, manifestly beholding the
delightfull duties of reciprocall loue, such as I was perswaded would
haue kindled <i>Diana</i> hir selfe?</p>

<p class = "main">
Whereupon I was bold to shew that folly which tormented my inward
spirits, enuying to see what others possessed, that was a continuall
delight in pleasure and solace without any wearines in full cloying, and
thus diuers times my hart being set on fire by my eies, and extreemely
burning, my minde still fixed vpon delightfull pleasures and their
smacking kisses, and regarding with a curious eie the abounding guerdons
of the fethered god, me thought at that instant, that I did behold the
extreeme perfection of pleasure. And by this meanes I stood wauering and
out of measure amazed, and as one which had droonke an amorous potion,
calling into remembrance the ointments of the mischeeuous <i>Circes</i>,
the forcible hearbs of <i>Medea</i>, the hurtfull songs of
<i>Byrrena</i>, and the deadly verses of <i>Pamphile</i>, I stood
doubtfull that my eies had seene somthing more than humane, and that a
base, dishonorable, and frail bodie should not be where immortall

<p class = "main">
After that I was brought from these long and doubtfull thoughts and
phantasticall imaginations, and remembring all those maruellous diuine
shapes and bodies which I had personally seene with mine eies, I then
knew that they were not deceitfull shadowes, nor magicall illusions, but
that I had not rightly conceiued of them.</p>

<p class = "main">
And now with earnest consideration among these beholding the most
excellent Nymph fast by me, my eies filled with amorous darts ceased not
to wound my passionate hart, by means wherof incontinently all my
wandering thoughts were stirred vp, compact, and fixed vpon hir their
desired obiect, recalling my mortified soule afresh to be tormented in
his first flames, which most cruelly I suffered, in that I durst not be
bold to aske if she were my desired <i>Polia</i>, for she had put me in
some doubt thereof before, and now fearing to offend hir with my being
ouer bolde, and ore troublesome with my rude and vntilled toong, diuers
times when my voice was breaking out betwixt my lips, vpon that occasion
I suppressed the same. But what she should be, it was beyond my compasse
to imagine, and I stood as suspicious thereof, as the deceiued
<i>Socia</i> with the fained <i>Atlantiades</i>. Thus with diligent
regards and cordiall searches examining hir heauenly features inuaded
with a burning desire beyond measure, I said to my self: Oh that I might
be, if it were possible, a free mã in such a place, for no sorrow
shoulde greeue me, nor imminent danger should make me afraid: although
that frowarde fortune shoulde oppose hir selfe against me, I woulde
spende my life without any regard therof, not refusing to vndertake the

solacious places, and aboue all to enioy the precious loue and
inestimable good wil of hir, more faire without comparison, then

life and death is in hir power! And if so be that I seeme vnwoorthie of
hir fellowshippe and amorous commers, yet would God it might be granted
me as a speciall rewarde and priuiledge to looke vpon hir: and then I
saide to my selfe, oh <i>Poliphilus</i>, if these heauie and burthenous
weights of amarous conceits do oppresse thee; the sweetenes of the
fruite doth allure thee thereunto: and if the peremptorie dangers strike
thee into a terror, the hope of the supportation and helpe of so faire a
Nymph will animate thee to be resolute. Thus my thought being diuers, I
said, Oh God, if this be that desired <i>Polia</i> which I see at this
present, and whose precious impression without intermission, I haue stil
born in my burning and wounded hart, fro the first yeers of my loue
vntil this present, I am contented with all sorrows, &amp; besides hir,
I desire no other request but only this, that she may be drawne to my
feruent loue, that it may be with vs alike, or that I may be at liberty,
for I am no longer able to dissemble my griefe, or hide the extremity of
my smart, I die liuing, &amp; liuing am as dead: I delight in that which
is my griefe: I go mourning: I consume my self in the flame, &amp; yet
the flame doth norish me, &amp; burning like gold in the strong cement,
yet I find my self like cold yce. Ah wo is me, that loue should be more
greeuous vnto me then the weight of <i>Iuarime</i> to <i>Typhon</i>. It
disperseth me more, then the rauenous vulturs the glomerated bowels of
<i>Tityus</i>: It holdeth me in more, then the labirinth crooking: It
tosseth me more, then the northeast winds the calme seas: It teareth me
woorse then <i>Acteons</i> dogges their flieng master: It troubleth my
spirits more then horrible death doth them who desire to liue: It is
more direfull to my vexed hart, then the crocodils bowels to
<i>Ichneumon</i>. And so much the more is my greefe, that with all the
wit I haue, I knowe not to thinke in what part of the worlde I shoulde
be, but streight before the

<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
sweete fire of this halfe goddesse, which without any corporall
substance consumeth me: hir aboundant and faire yealow haire, a snare
and net for my hart to be masked in: hir large and phlegmatique
forehead, like white lillies, bynd me in as with a withe: hir pearcing
regards take away my life as sweete prouocations to afflict me: hir
roseall cheekes do exasperate my desire, hir ruddie lips continue the
same, and hir delicious breasts like the winter snow vpon the
hyperboreall mountaines, are the sharp spurs and byting whip to my
amorous passions: hir louely gestures and pleasant countenance do draw
my desire to an imaginatiue delight, heaping vp my sorrow. And to all
these insulting martyrdoms and greeuous vexations of that impious and
deceitfull <i>Cupid</i> I laie open, mightilie striuing to beare them,
and no waie able to resist them, but to suffer my selfe to be ouercome:
neither coulde I shun the same, but remained still as one vnawares lost

And hauing had these discourses with my selfe, I began secretly to
mourne and weepe, and desire a way that I might die, fetching deepe

diuers times I had purposed with a lamentable voice to desire hir helpe,
for that I was at the point of death: but as one drowned and
ouerwhelmed, I deemed that way to be vaine, and to no purpose, and
therfore furiously, and as one of a raging spirit I thought thus: Why
doest thou doubt, <i>Poliphilus</i>? Death for loue is laudable, and
therefore my greeuous and malignant fortune, my sorrowful accident and
hard hap in the loue of so beautifuil a Nymph,

<p class = "main">
And thus continuing the follie of my thoughts, I said: It may be that
this Nymph, by al likelihoods, is some reuerend goddesse, and therefore
my speeches will be but as the crackling reedes of Archadia in the moist
and fennie sides of the riuer Labdone, shaken with the sharpe east wind,
with the boisterous north, cloudy south &amp; rainie south west wind.
Besides this, the gods will be seuere reuengers of such an insolencie,
for the companions of <i>Vlysses</i> had been preserued from drowning
and shipwracke, if they had not stolne <i>Apollos</i> cattell kept by
<i>Phaetusa</i> and hir sister <i>Lampetia</i>. <i>Orion</i> had not

<i>Diana</i>, and therefore if I should vse any indecencie against the
honor of this Nymph in any sort, such like reuenge or woorse woulde be
vsed vpon me. At last getting foorth of these changeable thoughts, I did
greatly comfort my selfe in beholding and contemplating the excellent
proportion and sweete sauour of this ingenuous and most rare Nymph,
containing in hir al whatsoeuer that may prouoke amorous conceits and
sweete loue, giuing from hir faire eies so gratious and fauorable
regards, as thereby I somewhat tempered my troublesome and vnbrideled
thoughts. And my resounding sighes reflexed with a flattering hope (oh
the amorous foode of louers and sauce of salt teares) by these and no
other rains I did manage my vehement thoughts, and made them stop in a
conceiued hope, fixing mine eies with excessiue delight vpon hir faire
bodie and well disposed members, by all which, my discontented desires
were gently mitigated and redeemed from that furie and amorous fire,
which so neere had bred the extremitie of my passions.</p>

diffluent streames, sliding downe the moist vallies betwixt the crooked
hils in their grauelled channels, and into the next seas with a
continued course softly vnlading themselues.</p>

<i>Thessalie</i> is a region of Greece, hauing vpon the one side
Macedonia, and on the other Bœotia, reaching betweene Thermopylæ, and
the riuer Pineus, euen to the sea side, it is the gardẽ of
Grecia.</span>
A ground most healthfull, the grasse coole and sweet: and from the trees
resounded the sweete consents of small chirping birds. The flouds and
fields of Thessalie must giue place to this.</p>

<p class = "main">
And there sitting thus togither among the sweete flowers and redolent
roses, I fastened mine eies vpon this heauenly shape of so faire and
rare a proportion, whereunto my sences were so applied, drawen and
addicted, that my hart was ouerwhelmed with extreeme delights, so as I
remained senceles, and yet cast into a curious desire to vnderstand and
knowe what should be the reason and cause that the purple humiditie in
the touch of hir bodie, in the smoothnes of hir hand should be as white
as pure milke: and by what meanes that nature had bestowed in hir faire
bodie the fragrant sweetnes of Arabia.

<i>Heraclea</i>, is the name of diuers faire cities, one in the confines
of Europe, another in Italie &amp; in Pontus by the riuer Licus, also in
Narbon by Rodanus, also in Caria, Crete &amp; Lydia, whereof the
Lodestone taketh his name.<br>
<i>Hesperides</i>, were the 3. daughters of Atlas, Ægle, Aretusa and
Hesperetusa, who had an orchard of goldẽ apples, kept by a dragon whõ
Hercules slew &amp; tooke away the apples.<br>
A sepulcher built by Artemisia in the honor of hir husbande Mausolus
king of <ins class = "mycorr" title = "so in

<!---->
And by what industrie in hir starrie forehead pampynulated with threds
of gold aptly disposed, she had infixed the fairest part of the heauens,
or the splendycant Heraclea.</p>

<p class = "main">
Afterward letting fall mine eies towards hir prety feete, I beheld them
inclosed in red leather cut vpon white, fastened vpon the instep with
buttons of gold in loopes of blew silke. And from thence I returned
vpward my wanton regard to hir straight necke compassed about with a
carkenet of orient pearle, striuing but not able to match with the
whitenes of the sweet skin. From thence descending down to hir shining
breast and delitious bosome, from whence grew two round apples, such as
<i>Hercules</i> neuer stole out of the garden of <i>Hesperides</i>.
Neither did euer <i>Pomona</i> behold the like to these two standing
vnmooueable in hir roseall breast, more white than hils of snowe in the
going downe of the sunne. Betwixt the which there passed downe a
delicious vallie, wherein was the
<!--png 209-->
<span class = "verso">[<i>v</i>]</span>
delicate sepulcher of my wounded hart exceeding the famous
<i>Mausolea</i>.</p>

<p class = "main">
I then being content with a wounded hart full well vnderstanding that
mine eies had drawen it dying into all these elegant parts. Yet
neuertheles I could not so bridle and suppresse my amorous inflamed
sighes, or so closely couer them, but that they would needs expresse my
inward desire.</p>

<p class = "main">
By means whereof she was changed from contagious loue, and striking with
hir stolen regards (enuying the same) she turned it vpon me, so as I
perceiued an incensing fire pruriently diffusing it selfe through my
inward parts and hollow veines: and during the contemplate beholding of
hir most rare and excellent beautie, a mellifluous delight and sweete
solace constrained me thereunto. Thus disordinately beaten with the
importune spur of vnsatiable desire, I found my selfe to be set vpon
with the mother of loue, inuironed round about with hir flamigerous
sonne, and inuaded with so faire a shape, that I was with these and
others so excellent circumstances brought into such an agonie of minde
and sicknes of bodie, and in such sort infeebled, that the least haire
of hir head was a band forcible ynough to hold me fast, and euery rowled
tramell a chaine and shackle to fetter me, being fed with the sweetnes
of hir beautie, and hooked with the pleasant baits of hir amorous
delights, that I was not able with whatsoeuer cunning deuise to resist
the inuading heates and prouoking desires still comming vpon me, that I
determined rather to die than longer to endure the same, or in this
solitarie place to offer hir any dishonor.</p>

<p class = "main">
Then againe I was determined with humble requests and submissiue
intreaties to say thus:</p>

<p class = "main">
Alas most delighted <i>Polia</i>, at this present to die by thee is a
thing that I desire, and my death if it were effected by these thy
small, slender and faire hands, the ende thereof should be more
tolerable, sweete and glorious vnto me, bicause my hart is compassed
about with such tormenting flames, still more and more cruelly
increasing, and burning the same without pitie or intermission, so as by
meanes thereof I am bereft of all rest.</p>

<p class = "main">
And heerewithall intending to put in execution another
<!--png 210-->
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
determinate purpose, behold my hart was tormented with more sharpe
flames, that me thought I was all of a light fire. Ah wo is me what wert
thou aduised to do <i>Poliphilus</i>? Remember the violence done to
<i>Deianira</i> and the chaste Roman lady. Consider what followed them
for a reward, and diuers others.</p>

<p class = "main">
Call to minde that mighty princes haue beene reiected of their
inferiors, how much more then a base and abiect person, but tract of
time giueth place to them which expect the bountie thereof. Time causeth
the fierce lions to be tame, and whatsoeuer furious beast: the small ant
by long trauell laieth vp hir winter foode in the hard tree, and shall
not a diuine shape lying hid in a humane bodie take the impression of
feruent loue, and then holding the same, shake off all annoyous and
vexing passions, hoping to enioy amorous fruits, desired effects, and
triumphing agonismes.</p>

<p class = "main">
The Nymph <i>Polia</i> perceiuing well the change of my colour and blood
comming in more stranger sort than <i>Tripolion</i> or <i>Teucrion</i>,
thrise a day changing the colour of his flowers, and my indeuoring to
sende out scalding sighes deeply set from the bottome of my hart, she
did temper and mitigate the same with hir sweete and friendly regards,
pacifieng the rage of my oppressing passions, so as notwithstanding my
burning minde in these continuall flames and sharpe prouocations of
loue, I was aduised patiently to hope euen with the bird of Arabia in
hir sweet nest of small sprigs, kindled by the heate of the sunne to be
renewed.</p>

The printed book used an unusual page-numbering system. Only the
recto (front) side of each folio (leaf) had a printed number. In this
e-text, the unnumbered verso (back, overleaf) pages are shown in the
margin as [v]. In addition, the first two or three leaves in each
eight-page signature are numbered: A, A2, A3... B,&nbsp;B2....<br>
Oddities of punctuation are as in the original, but missing full stops
at paragraph-end have been supplied.<br>
<br>
<b>The Text</b><br>
This e-text is based on a facsimile edition made from a single copy of
the 1592 original. In some places, text is illegible or missing.<br>
“The Italian version” refers to the 1499 text. At time of preparation,
page images of this book were available at <a href =
"http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/HP/hyp000.htm">http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/HP/hyp000.htm</a>
and linked pages. Note that the 1592 English translation covers just
under half the Italian text. Within these pages, the translation
reproduces one-third (22 of 70) of the illustrations of the Italian
edition, concentrated in the early part of the book. The Italian text
was consulted in some cases of uncertain readings in the English. The
sidenotes have no Italian equivalent.<br>
<br>
<b>Illustrations:</b><br>
Some pairs of illustrations were printed on facing pages and would have
been seen together. They are shown here as thumbnails, along with some
facing pages from the Italian version.<br>
<br>
<b>Greek and Inscriptions:</b><br>
The Greek text often introduces additional errors that were not present
in the Italian version. Among other problems, the text uses a form of
Π (Pi) that is easily confused with Γ (Gamma), and an Υ (Upsilon) that
resembles Τ (Tau). The Arabic text could not be transcribed.</div>

The translation of the Italian version is similar to the accompanying
Greek and Latin; the English version is nonsense. Apparently the
engraver did not know that Hebrew is written from right to left. The
“last” (rightmost) two words of the first line were moved to the
“beginning” (left edge) of the second line, and then the “last”
(rightmost) three words of this line were moved down to make a new

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
